# Monkey Type Clone
This is a static clone of [Monkey Type](https://www.monkeytype.com), built using pure JavaScript for key events. The site is designed with responsive web design, mimicking the appearance and functionality of Monkey Type in terms of CSS. Features include calculating words per minute (WPM) after a typing test and blurring the screen when the typing area is out of focus. Currently, the backspace feature is not supported. Not that it is difficult, but it's a lot more code and states
## Features
